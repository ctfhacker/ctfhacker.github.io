I am a senior security researcher for <a href="http://www.talosintelligence.com/vulnerability-reports/">Cisco Talos</a> and play on Samurai for CTFs. Being happily married, CTFs, tool development, and singing barbershop take up the majority of my time. This blog is the home for my CTF writeups, development tricks, and other random hacker tips.
